# This is a demo of django's API versioning
# Here's a summary of the things involved:
# First, we added REST_FRAMEWORK = {
#     "DEFAULT_VERSIONING_CLASS": "rest_framework.versioning.URLPathVersioning"
# } to our settings.py.
# Then, we defined a URL path containing <version>, in our main urlpatterns
# which is the standard
# way of handling the version and DRF expects it to be that name by default
# We added a new url into our main urlpatterns which is included.
# Thereafter, we defined a new url into our demo_app1's urlpatterns
# (I still can't see why is this separation of urlpatterns)
# Finally, once we have configured the URL with the <version>,
# we can try to create a new view and retrieve the version in our view
@api_view(["GET"])
def demo_version(request, *args, **kwargs):
    version = request.version
    return Response(data={"msg": f"You have hit {version} of demo-api"})


# We see that it returns any version the user provide. This
# might so this might create confusion for the end user hitting
# the endpoint. To solve this problem, we shall see how we can
# customize the version class of DRF so that we can add constraints
# that can help us design better applications.
# First, create a file called demo_app/custom_versions.py.
# This file will have a custom version class for each view,
# along with a default class for all the views that donâ€™t
# have multiple versions yet


# we integrate the custom version class (note that the custom versioning_class
# can be only linked to a class-based view, so we are using APIView here)

# and we'll get to the minor detailed differences later
